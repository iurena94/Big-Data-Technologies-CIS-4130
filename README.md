## Description
This project aims to identify the characteristics of a specific genre of visual art. Through the collection and evaluation of images from WikiArt.org, the probability a new image falls into an art genre can be derived. The abundance of features identify images such as color composition, size, objects depicted, etc. These features can be used to determine any similarities, differences, or patterns amongst all images, and will be used to predict their genre. I'll be experimenting with linear regression to group the probability an image falls under a specific catergory using numerical data. Below are images of the numerical data that will be used for each image, as well as a confusion matrix of the final model.
